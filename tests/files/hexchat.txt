synopsis:            Haskell scripting interface for HexChat
description:
 This package builds a shared object ready for loading into HexChat, that will compile and interpret scripts written in Haskell; and also a Haskell library that said scripts should import and use to interface with HexChat.
 .
 At the moment the scripting interface is not finalized and may (and will) change in a future.
 .
 At the moment only Linux is supported.
 .
 For instructions on how to write a script, see the 'HexChat' module.
 .
 Currently the plugin only understands the classic @/load@, @/unload@, @/reload@ commands.
 .
 To automatically load the plugin symlink or copy @~\/.cabal\/lib\/libhexchat-haskell.so@ (or @\/usr\/local\/lib\/libhexchat-haskell.so@) to @~\/.config\/hexchat\/addons\/@ (or @\/usr\/lib\/hexchat\/plugins\/@).
